# PS4 9.00 PSN Blocklist for Pi-hole

Last updated: January 28, 2022

An up-to-date blocklist (as of date mentioned above) to use on Pi-hole with the PS4 to prevent access to PSN.
Tested on PS4 Pro running jailbroken firmware 9.00 in the US.
Any future updates beyond firmware 9.00 are not guaranteed to block everything with this blocklist until tested.
Any new entries that show up in my Pi-hole's query log coming from the console will be added to this list.
This list will (from my tests) completely block PSN on the console everywhere to the point of keeping your account signed out.

Thanks to Al-Azif, depressive_monk, and phoanglong for compiling the original lists.
