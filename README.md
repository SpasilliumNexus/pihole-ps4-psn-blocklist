# PS4 9.00 PSN Blocklist for Pi-hole

<i>Last updated: January 28, 2022</i>

An up-to-date blocklist (as of date mentioned above) to use on Pi-hole with the PS4 to prevent access to PSN.<br>
Tested on PS4 Pro running jailbroken firmware 9.00 in the US.<br>
Any future updates beyond firmware 9.00 are not guaranteed to block everything with this blocklist until tested.<br>
Any new entries that show up in my Pi-hole's query log coming from the console will be added to this list.<br>
This list will (from my tests) completely block PSN on the console everywhere to the point of keeping your account signed out.<br><br>

Thanks to Al-Azif, depressive_monk, and phoanglong for compiling the original lists.
